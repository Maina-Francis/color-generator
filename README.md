This is a simple React app where users can pass in color hex codes and get back their various variations, tint, and weight.
```
The lightness or darkness of a color is called its value. Tints are light values that are made by mixing a color with white, which increases lightness. Shades are dark values that are made by mixing a color with black, which reduces lightness
```
Users can also copy the hexcodes of any color tint to clipboard.

## External Resources Used
To get the colors, we used external library called [Values.js](https://noeldelgado.github.io/values.js/).
